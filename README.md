# Ping Mini-Lab

## 🔧 Objective
Simulate a basic IT troubleshooting task by using the `ping` command to test connectivity to various domains.

## 🧪 What I Did
- Ran `ping` on multiple websites (e.g., google.com, facebook.com, 8.8.8.8)
- Verified successful replies to confirm network reachability

## 💡 What I Learned
- `ping` checks if a device or site is reachable over a network
- Getting “Reply from” = it's alive  
- If it times out = there’s a problem (could be DNS, firewall, etc.)
